This program was designed to, given a root URL address, use iterative deepening depth-first search (based on a user-specified depth) to traverse the web associated with user-specified root URL address, save the HTML code of each webpage expanded as a text file, and perform character recognition on the HTML code to develop a feature vector associated with that HTML code.

The code for this program can be found at https://github.com/JSLBrowning/Assignment-1-WebCrawler-and-Feature-Extraction.
